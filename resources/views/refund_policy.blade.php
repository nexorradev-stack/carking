            <h2>1. Non-Refundable Payments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One-Off Advertising Fees:</strong> All one-off payments made to advertise your car for 7 days
                    are non-refundable once the advert is posted, regardless of whether your car sells before the end of
                    the 7-day period.</li>
                <li><strong>Weekly Subscription Payments:</strong> Weekly subscription payments are non-refundable.
                    Users are charged weekly until they cancel their subscription. If you forget to cancel your
                    subscription, you will not be entitled to a refund for any payments already processed.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum Subscription Period:</strong> The minimum cost for a weekly subscription is one
                    week's payment. Refunds will not be issued for partial weeks or unused time within the subscription
                    period.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Subscription Cancellations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How to Cancel:</strong> Users can cancel their subscription at any time through their account
                    settings. Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and no further charges
                    will be made.</li>
                <li><strong>No Pro-Rated Refunds:</strong> Once a subscription payment is processed, you will have access
                    to the advertising service until the end of the billing period. No pro-rated refunds will be issued
                    for unused time.</li>
