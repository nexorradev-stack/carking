Built from the ground up over a 3 year period of ownership, George Cummings who was originally a diesel mechanic and had a keen interest in all things machinery & fabrication, would spend the majority of his free time tinkering away in his fifty square foot garage built beside the family home, optimised for mainly lorries and articulated machinery. However, Land Rovers were George's forte, with a number of various models being built over the years in his workshop which was occupied by a collection of vintage Land Rovers parts and machinery which he had scouted out over the years, building upon his collection and bringing life back into classics which were due some TLC. George unfortunately passed away earlier this year, however we were lucky enough to pick up one of his finest works a few months ago at auction. This 1953 Series 1 is a prime example of his craftsmanship which we are delighted to have had the chance to display here in our showroom at Roadside Garages, Coleraine. Born on 1/1/1953 and with 1 previous keeper this stunning Green Land Rover series 1 Soft Top has covered just 82.3k miles.
